# Network Observability plugin for Openshift Console

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/netobserv/network-observability-console-plugin/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/netobserv/network-observability-console-plugin)

Based on [Openshift Console dynamic plugin](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk), this plugin implement the console elements for Network Observability.

## Building, linting, testing

To build the plugin, run:

```bash
make build
```

To run tests and linter:

```bash
make test lint
```

These targets will build / lint / test both the backend and the frontend. They have selective equivalent to build/lint/test only the backend or the frontend (e.g. `make build-frontend`).

There are also convenient targets to build+lint+test the backend or the frontend:

```bash
make frontend
make backend
```

## Development environment

Plugin can be served locally using the following command:

```bash
make serve
```

(It's the same as running ./http-server.sh)

Make sure you are logged in your OpenShift cluster before with the CLI (`oc login -u kubeadmin` ...)

You need also to have a local copy of [console repository](https://github.com/openshift/console)
Build it once using:
```bash
./build.sh
```

Then, start the console bridge with this local plugin, with:
```bash
CONSOLE=/path/to/console make bridge
```

Then open http://localhost:9000/.

If you have troubles trying to run the console, refer to their doc: https://github.com/openshift/console/#openshift-no-authentication.

### Loki in dev mode

You need to deploy Loki and port-forward on your host: `oc port-forward service/loki 3100:3100`

(You don't need Grafana)

## OCI Image

Images are located on https://quay.io/repository/netobserv/network-observability-console-plugin. To use the latest image corresponding to branch `main`, use `quay.io/netobserv/network-observability-console-plugin:main`.

### Build

```bash
# build the default image (quay.io/netobserv/network-observability-console-plugin:main):
make image

# build and push on your own quay.io account (quay.io/myuser/network-observability-console-plugin:main):
IMG_USER=myuser make image push

# build and push on a different registry
IMAGE=dockerhub.io/myuser/plugin:tag make image push
```

### Testing in OpenShift

Probably the easiest way to test without dev mode (e.g. to test a pull request) is to use the [operator](https://github.com/netobserv/network-observability-operator/), build and push the image to your own registry account and update the `FlowCollector` CR to update the plugin image.

E.g:

```bash
IMAGE=quay.io/${USER}/network-observability-console-plugin:pr-xx make image push

oc edit FlowCollector cluster
# Here replace image with the newly created one under .spec.consolePlugin.image
```

If you had previously used the console with the plugin installed, you may need to restart console pods to clear cache:

```bash
oc delete pods -n openshift-console -l app=console
```
