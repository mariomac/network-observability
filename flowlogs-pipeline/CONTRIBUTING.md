# Contributing to flowlogs-pipeline

:fire: A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to flowlogs-pipeline open source project! :fire:  

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. 
Please read the following notes to learn how the contribute process works.

## Pull Request Process

1. Follow [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) guidelines.
1. We use git actions to gate pull requests.   
   - Pull Requests need to at least pass `make build` and `make test`.
   - Pull Requests need to be approved by at least one reviewer.  
1. For golang code, follow standard coding convention as described [here](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).
   - Use `go fmt` and `golangci-lint` to lint and verify code style.
1. for all other contributions, follow existing project coding style (by example).    
1. Connecting an issue to pull Request is always a preference.
1. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, 
   but bigger changes should look like this:
   
```shell
> git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit

A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Bugs, enhancements and questions

1. Use git [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to document bugs, enhancements and questions.
1. Be as clear, concise and simple as possible.
1. Good example can always help to clear things. Please use examples when possible.
